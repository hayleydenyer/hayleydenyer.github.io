## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hayley. I am about to submit my PhD that used remote measurement technology (fancy name for smartphones and wearable devices) to develop a remote monitoring battery for adolescents and adults with ADHD!

Have a look around, and if you're interested in hearing more about my work, don't hesitate to get in touch!
