I have spent the last 3.5 years investigating the acceptability of remote measurement technology (RMT) and its uses in capturing sleep behaviours and real-world medication treatment response of individuals with ADHD.

It has been super exciting developing a remote monitoring battery to help assess and manage ADHD symptoms and impairments. The remote monitoring battery includes both active and passive data. Active data requires the individual to engage with the technology, so we often collect active data by asking individuals to answer questionnaires on their smartphone, focus on cognitive tasks on a computer, or complete speech tasks. Passive data requires little to no involvement from the individual, and we usually collect this through wearable devices and smartphones. We collect a wide range of passive data, including sleep, physical activity, heart rate (all from a wearable device) as well as, but not limited to, Bluetooth connectivity, relative location, and ambient light and noise (all through the [RADAR-base](https://radar-base.org/){:target="_blank"} smartphone passive app)


During my PhD and time at King's College London, I have developed my quantiative and qualitative skills. I used qualitative methods to analyse in-depth interviews of the barriers of and facilitators to using RMT with individuals with ADHD. This analysis was incorporated into a new ADHD Remote Technology project, called ART-CARMA! 

I used real-time real-world time series analyses to explore sleep features and sleep hygiene behaviours of individuals with and without ADHD over a 10-week remote monitoring period, and to explore medication treatment response in adults with ADHD. My R coding skills and knowledge have come on a long way since my early days of my PhD - let's just say linear mixed models are my ~~enemy~~ new best friends! 

I have also presented (oral and poster) at many [local and international conferences](./speaking-engagements.md), as I love sharing our findings to both the scientific and non-scientific community!
